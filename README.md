UFC Schedule

#### See all the events scheduled for MMA and Boxing all in one place! 

## Description
I made this app as a resource for myself. As a combat sport fan, I wanted to see who fighting in the UFC and in Boxing this week. Normally this would take 2 searches for the UFC schedule and the Boxing schedule. But now, it's all in one place! The information is scraped from other websites and displayed using node.js and React.
